# In the seminar carried out in CT001 on May 16th, we learned about connections and we were shown some examples of connections and tools that can be used.

These are some of the things that were shown to us:

1- Water/Rain sensor.

When the sensor touches water the small LED light will turn on showing a small red light indicating that it is touching water.

2- Traffic light connection.
These are how the LED lights look.

Now you can see how the traffic light works.

With the use of C++, the main board was programmed to turn on each light in a specific sequence (Red, Orange, Green).

Here you can see what components you will need to make your very own traffic light.

Here we have two examples of what a main programmable board can look like.

These are some components that you can find in your everyday electronics that can be connected to a main board and reprogrammed to do a specific function.

### We use C++ to program the motherboards so that the electrical components can function in the way that is wanted.

## Electrical components get connected to the board via the pins and pin holes located in the motherboard as well as the ports that the board also has.

# All boards must be connected to a power source in order to function and in this seminar ,the presenter's laptop was used as the main power source, as you can see there is always a blue USB cable attached to the board.
