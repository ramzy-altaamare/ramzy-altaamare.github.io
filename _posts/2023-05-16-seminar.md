### In the seminar carried out in CT001 on May 16th, we learned about connections and we were shown some examples of connections and tools that can be used.

These are some of the things that were shown to us:

1- Water/Rain sensor.

When the sensor touches water the small LED light will turn on showing a small red light indicating that it is touching water.

2- Traffic light connection.

These are how the LED lights look.

Now you can see how the traffic light works.

With the use of C++, the main board was programmed to turn on each light in a specific sequence (Red, Orange, Green).


Here you can see what components you will need to make your very own traffic light.

Here we have an example of what a main programmable board can look like.

These are some components that you can find in your everyday electronics that can be connected to a main board and reprogrammed to do a specific function.

#### We use C++ to program the motherboards so that the electrical components can function in the way that is wanted.

#### Electrical components get connected to the board via the pins and pin holes located in the motherboard as well as the ports that the board also has.

### *All boards must be connected to a power source in order to function and in this seminar ,the presenter's laptop was used as the main power source, as you can see there is always a blue USB cable attached to the board.*

#### Reflection

We had a great opportunity to learn more about ARDUINO and to see some of its practical implementations throughout the session. We were skilfully guided through a range of experiments by our special guest instructor so that we could understand the ARDUINO boards principles and functionality. We had the chance to research different sensors, actuators, and coding techniques, which broadened our understanding of electronics and programming.
The presentation was really engaging, which made it both fun and instructive. We were inspired by the instructor's passion and knowledge, which aroused our interest and sparked a number of stimulating discussions. Through hands-on testing, we gained a better understanding of how ARDUINO may be utilized to generate original concepts and automate numerous processes.
We gained new views on ARDUINO as a result of the workshop, which was a wonderful learning experience overall. It not only enhanced our technical skills but also motivated us to look into further opportunities in this exciting industry. We are grateful for the opportunity to learn from a teacher with such a wealth of knowledge, and we look forward to using what we have learned in the future.
