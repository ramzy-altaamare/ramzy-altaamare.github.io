The IEEE Top 10 Vulnerabilities list was last updated in 2021, and as far as I'm aware, the cutoff date for this list is September 2021. However, as these were the most current iterations of each list at the moment, I may talk about the distinctions between the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2021 and the IEEE Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2021.

The objectives and scopes of the IEEE Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2021 and the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2021 differ. The IEEE Top 10 Vulnerabilities list contains a wider spectrum of vulnerabilities that might affect all types of systems and applications, whereas the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities list is concentrated on web application security.

The addition of "Insufficient Attack Protection" in the IEEE Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2021 is one of the lists' biggest discrepancies. This category includes flaws caused by a lack of security measures that can effectively stop or lessen assaults. It has flaws such insufficient logging and monitoring, inefficient access limits, and insufficient encryption and data security.

In contrast, the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2021 list a category named "Broken Access Control," which covers comparable flaws in access controls and authentication but is concentrated solely on online applications. Issues like privilege escalation and access control bypass fall under this category as well.

The inclusion of "Insecure Design" in the IEEE Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2021 is another distinction between the two lists. This category addresses flaws in software design that might lead to security issues. Examples include inadequate input validation, unsafe network protocols, and poor encryption.

In contrast, the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2021 has a category named "Injection," which deals with flaws in unvalidated user input that allow attackers to inject harmful code or instructions. Well-known flaws like SQL injection and command injection fall under this category.

It is worth noting that both lists include categories related to vulnerabilities that can be exploited through social engineering tactics. The OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2021 includes a category called "Social Engineering," which covers weaknesses related to human behavior such as phishing and pretexting. The IEEE Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2021 includes a category called "Human Factor," which covers similar issues but also includes vulnerabilities related to insider threats and other forms of human error.

The OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2021 and the IEEE Top 10 Vulnerabilities 2021 do have certain similarities, but they also differ significantly in terms of breadth and concentration. Reviewing both lists, organizations should take into account the vulnerabilities that are most pertinent to their particular systems and applications.
