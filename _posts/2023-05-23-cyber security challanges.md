## Cyber Security Challenges in Digital Economy

In order to evaluate their cyber security procedures, a preliminary research study was undertaken on major Croatian firms connected to significant or vital national infrastructure (NI or CNI). The study's objectives were to examine the efficiency of control mechanisms in reducing cyber risks and to emphasize the importance of ongoing development, teamwork, and a pro-active approach to cybersecurity in order to successfully meet the changing threat landscape. A survey questionnaire and in-depth interviews with cyber security experts from nine chosen firms were part of the research approach.

The sampled businesses were from a range of sectors, including telecommunications, energy, IT, insurance, and finance. Whether as board members, C-suite executives, CISOs, or cyber security advisers, every company has somebody in charge of cyber security. These people reported on cyber security to the highest executive levels while regularly assessing the efficacy of security safeguards.

The results showed that the tested businesses have developed and efficient controls in place. They adhered to laws governing cyber security, set aside around 1% of their annual revenue for it, and had important internal rules. The research did, though, identify certain areas for development, such as boosting staff understanding of cyber security risks, enhancing technical and academic abilities, and putting in place more sophisticated preventative and investigative procedures.

Overall, the study found that although the sampled organizations showed fundamental organizational and technological controls to be effective, there was still a need to promote a more comprehensive and team-based approach to cyber security. The whole company strategy and organizational culture should be interwoven with the IT departments' responsibilities for cyber security. This comprehensive strategy includes proactive implementation of strong security measures, continual improvement efforts to adapt to the changing threat landscape, and engagement with stakeholders and peers in the industry to exchange information and resources.

This pilot study offers useful insights into the cyber security procedures used by Croatian businesses connected to significant or vital national infrastructure. The report emphasizes the need of effectively tackling the dynamic threat landscape by highlighting the necessity for continual development, teamwork, and a proactive approach to cybersecurity. To further examine these concerns and contribute to the development of cybersecurity practices, the authors want to carry out more study using a bigger and more varied sample in the future.
