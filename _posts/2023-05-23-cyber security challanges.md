## Cyber Security Challenges in Digital Economy
(Mario Spremić, Member, IAENG, Alen Šimunic)


In order to evaluate their cyber security procedures, a preliminary research study was undertaken on major Croatian firms connected to significant or vital national infrastructure (NI or CNI). The study's objectives were to examine the efficiency of control mechanisms in reducing cyber risks and to emphasize the importance of ongoing development, teamwork, and a pro-active approach to cybersecurity in order to successfully meet the changing threat landscape. A survey questionnaire and in-depth interviews with cyber security experts from nine chosen firms were part of the research approach.

The sampled businesses were from a range of sectors, including telecommunications, energy, IT, insurance, and finance. Whether as board members, C-suite executives, CISOs, or cyber security advisers, every company has somebody in charge of cyber security. These people reported on cyber security to the highest executive levels while regularly assessing the efficacy of security safeguards.

The results showed that the tested businesses have developed and efficient controls in place. They adhered to laws governing cyber security, set aside around 1% of their annual revenue for it, and had important internal rules. The research did, though, identify certain areas for development, such as boosting staff understanding of cyber security risks, enhancing technical and academic abilities, and putting in place more sophisticated preventative and investigative procedures.

Overall, the study found that although the sampled organizations showed fundamental organizational and technological controls to be effective, there was still a need to promote a more comprehensive and team-based approach to cyber security. The whole company strategy and organizational culture should be interwoven with the IT departments' responsibilities for cyber security. This comprehensive strategy includes proactive implementation of strong security measures, continual improvement efforts to adapt to the changing threat landscape, and engagement with stakeholders and peers in the industry to exchange information and resources.

This pilot study offers useful insights into the cyber security procedures used by Croatian businesses connected to significant or vital national infrastructure. The report emphasizes the need of effectively tackling the dynamic threat landscape by highlighting the necessity for continual development, teamwork, and a proactive approach to cybersecurity. To further examine these concerns and contribute to the development of cybersecurity practices, the authors want to carry out more study using a bigger and more varied sample in the future.

## Reflection:
The research study done on significant or essential national infrastructure (NI or CNI)-connected Croatian enterprises gave useful insights into their cybersecurity practices and identified crucial areas for development. In order to effectively confront the changing threat landscape, the research stressed the need of continual growth, cooperation, and a proactive approach to cybersecurity.

The results showed that the tested companies had set up effective controls and adhered to cybersecurity laws. They have internal policies in place and dedicated a sizeable amount of their annual income to cybersecurity. The research did note certain areas that required work, though, including bettering staff comprehension of cybersecurity threats, bolstering technical and academic skills, and putting in place more advanced preventative and investigative procedures.

The necessity for a holistic and team-based approach to cybersecurity was one of the study's main conclusions. It became clear that the IT departments' responsibility for cybersecurity should be integrated with the overall business strategy and organizational culture. In order to react to the shifting threat landscape, this strategy calls for the proactive installation of strong security measures, ongoing improvement efforts, and collaboration with stakeholders and peers in the sector.

Although the study's main objective was to assess Croatian enterprises' cybersecurity practices, it also indirectly addressed the cybersecurity issues that the digital economy faces. For enterprises working in the digital space, the dynamic threat landscape, which is defined by constantly changing cyber dangers, creates considerable hurdles. The study stressed the need of ongoing research and proactive thinking in order to successfully address these issues and have a solid cybersecurity posture.

The pilot research gave useful information on the level of cybersecurity practices in Croatian companies connected to crucial national infrastructure. It emphasized the need of collaboration and a pro-active approach to cybersecurity and the necessity for continual efforts to meet the changing threat landscape. The authors stated their aim to carry out further studies with bigger and more varied samples in order to further contribute to the development of cybersecurity techniques.

This research study serves as a reminder that cybersecurity is a dynamic process that calls for continuing development and teamwork. Organizations confront growing cybersecurity concerns as the digital economy develops, necessitating proactive measures, teamwork, and a strong corporate commitment to upholding a safe digital environment.
