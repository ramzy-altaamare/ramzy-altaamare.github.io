## Activity 1 : Consulting a vulnerability database.
simple research
## Activity 2 : Metasploit Framework.
```
First we excecute the command "service postgresql start" to run the postgres database.
Second we excecute the command "msfdb innit" to initialize the database.
Third we excecute the command "msfconsole search -h" to display the search command options.
Fourth we excecute the command "msfconsole search CVE-2013-2465" to search the common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures for a particular vulnerability in the windows version of java.

```
Commands used:
service postgresql start.
msfdb innit.
msfconsole search -h.
msfconsole search CVE-2013-2465.
```
## Activity 3 : Capture File to Find the Attack(s).
I couldnt really find the "Reconnaissance" file so i continued the activity without it.

## Activity 4 : Assessing the impact of malware.

I did the same as what wasasked from us in downloading the malware and it worked.

I tried downloading the malware the first time.

Here i allowed the threat to be downloaded in my PC.

![datacamp certification](/assets/images/banners/lab-activities/4.1.png)

I tried to open it.

![datacamp certification](/assets/images/banners/lab-activities/4.2.png)

Was able to unblock it and run it.

## Activity 8 : Exploiting a Website Using SQL Injection.

As you can see i was unavle to connect and find the webpage.

## Reflection:

Recently, I've started delving into many facets of cybersecurity and studying subjects like malware analysis, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment. It's interesting to learn about these important areas that aid in locating and resolving security flaws in networks and computer systems.

I've been using a vulnerability database, among other things. Making use of a database containing details about well-known software and system vulnerabilities has been very beneficial. I may reduce the risks involved by taking the proper steps by remaining up to speed on the most recent vulnerabilities.

The Metasploit Framework, an extraordinarily potent tool for penetration testing and exploiting vulnerabilities, is another thing I've been exploring with. It offers a variety of payloads, exploits, and support modules to mimic actual attack scenarios. It's a terrific technique to find system and application flaws and comprehend how attackers can take advantage of them.

Another intriguing topic to investigate is the analysis of capture data to identify assaults. These capture files include network traffic records that may be examined with software like Wireshark. It's surprising how looking at these files may help you spot and comprehend network-based assaults or other odd behavior. Effectively identifying and minimizing potential security breaches is made possible by this.

I've been paying attention to how malware impact assessments are done. Malware analysis entails looking at harmful software to comprehend its actions, possible effects, and capabilities. I can create efficient tactics to control, eliminate, and stop such risks from harming users by analyzing the effects of malware.

I've also been analyzing protocols with Wireshark. I may record and examine network data using the potent network protocol analyzer Wireshark. I can learn more about network communication patterns, see abnormalities, and spot possible security risks by looking at protocols. Any professional in cybersecurity has to have it.

Another interesting feature has been the confirmation of spoofing attacks in Wireshark. I can identify and validate spoofing attacks, which entail pretending to be someone else on a network, by using Wireshark to analyze network data. This information enables me to put in place the proper security measures to thwart illegal access and safeguard private data.

My investigation has also included using scanning technologies. Open ports, weaknesses, and possible access points in networks and systems are found using scanning technologies. By using these tools, I can proactively identify vulnerabilities and fix them before hostile actors can take advantage of them.

Last but not least, I've been studying about SQL injection website exploitation. By inserting malicious SQL instructions, this widespread web application vulnerability enables attackers to modify a website's database. For web application security and spotting possible flaws that need to be corrected, understanding how to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities is essential.

In general, researching these subjects has increased my understanding of cybersecurity. I'm becoming quite knowledgeable in malware analysis, network analysis, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessment. It's thrilling to improve my abilities to recognize and reduce security threats since it helps to create systems and networks that are more secure.
