### Reflection:

I was shocked by how simple it was to overwhelm a website when I first tried a DDoS assault. The attack was launched with just a few clicks and a few lines of code. What was even more worrisome was the ease with which a malicious actor might continue the attack. I became aware of how open websites are to DDoS attacks and how simple it is for anybody to initiate one as a result.

It is certainly alarming how simple DDoS assaults are to execute. Anyone may start an assault due to the abundance of resources and methods on the internet. It involves more than merely taking down a website; it involves possible harm to a company's reputation, lost sales, and the expense of containing the assault.

DDoS assaults can also be used as a cover for data exfiltration or as a diversionary strategy to divert defenders from other attacks. They become a powerful weapon in the hands of bad actors as a result.

In conclusion, I've learned how important website security is through my experience running a DDoS assault. Not only must the proper technology be in place, but also the proper procedures and training must be in place in order to identify and respond to such assaults. It is our responsibility as responsible internet users to be aware of the dangers posed by such assaults and to take the necessary precautions to safeguard both ourselves and our companies.
