## Lab 3

The Metasploit command "use" is used to choose and activate a certain module for additional setup and execution.
The term "auxiliary" describes a particular sort of module that serves auxiliary purposes rather than directly exploiting vulnerabilities.
Denial of Service (abbreviated "dos") refers to the act of interfering with or deactivating a network service or resource.
The prefix "tcp" denotes that the module concentrates on TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connections, a widely used protocol for internet-based communication.
This module is specifically made to conduct "synflood"-style denial-of-service attacks. SYN Flood is a well-known form of denial-of-service attack that takes advantage of the three-way handshake phase of the TCP protocol to flood a target system with SYN (synchronization) requests, exhausting its resources and making it unusable or crash.
In order to perform a TCP SYN Flood attack as part of a penetration testing or network assessment procedure, the command "use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood" chooses and activates the Metasploit module. It's crucial to remember that it is unlawful and immoral to use this command or launch any kind of DoS attack without the necessary authorisation.

Another command unique to the Metasploit Framework is "show options". For the specified module, it is used to display the configuration options that are currently accessible and their current settings.
After using the "use" command to choose a certain module, you can use the "show options" command to examine the different settings and parameters related to that module. The target IP address or hostname, the port number, the payload option, and any other information that might be required for the module to operate effectively are frequently included in these choices.

The Metasploit Framework uses the command "set RPORT 80" to change the value of the "RPORT" option for the currently chosen module.
"RPORT" stands for "Remote Port" in Metasploit, and it denotes the target port on the remote machine you are aiming for. You may tell the module to use a certain port to connect with the remote system by setting the "RPORT" option to a specified value.
The "RPORT" option is set to port 80 in the example with the command "set RPORT 80". For HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) transmission, which is frequently used for web communication, port 80 is the default port. You may tell the module to communicate with the target system on port 80 by setting the "RPORT" parameter to 80.
After selecting the "RPORT" option, you can execute the module or make any other adjustments that are required. Keep in mind that based on the module you have chosen, certain choices and their associated values may change.

The Metasploit Framework uses the command "set RHOST 45.93.124.14" to modify the value of the "RHOST" option for the currently chosen module.
The term "RHOST" in Metasploit refers to "Remote Host" and denotes the hostname or IP address of the target system you wish to interface with or hack.
The "RHOST" option is set to the IP address 45.93.124.14 in the example provided by the command "set RHOST 45.93.124.14". This indicates that the module will seek out and contact the computer at that IP address.
After selecting the "RHOST" option, you can execute the module or make any other adjustments that are required. Use this command responsibly and only against systems that you have been given permission to test or evaluate.

The Metasploit Framework's "run" command is used to execute the chosen module with the specified arguments.
The "run" command may be used to start the functioning of the module after you have configured all of its essential arguments. Depending on the precise module you have chosen, the module will then carry out its stated function, such as exploiting a vulnerability, carrying out a reconnaissance mission, or launching an attack.
The "run" command causes the module's activities to be executed against the target system given by the configured parameters, such as the remote host (RHOST) and remote port (RPORT), when it is run. The terminal will display the module's execution results and indicate whether the operation was successful or unsuccessful.
It's crucial to use the "run" command properly and with caution, making sure you have the required permissions to carry out any operations on the target system. The use of Metasploit without authorization or with malevolent intent might have negative legal and ethical repercussions.

### Reflection:

I was shocked by how simple it was to overwhelm a website when I first tried a DDoS assault. The attack was launched with just a few clicks and a few lines of code. What was even more worrisome was the ease with which a malicious actor might continue the attack. I became aware of how open websites are to DDoS attacks and how simple it is for anybody to initiate one as a result.

It is certainly alarming how simple DDoS assaults are to execute. Anyone may start an assault due to the abundance of resources and methods on the internet. It involves more than merely taking down a website; it involves possible harm to a company's reputation, lost sales, and the expense of containing the assault.

DDoS assaults can also be used as a cover for data exfiltration or as a diversionary strategy to divert defenders from other attacks. They become a powerful weapon in the hands of bad actors as a result.

In conclusion, I've learned how important website security is through my experience running a DDoS assault. Not only must the proper technology be in place, but also the proper procedures and training must be in place in order to identify and respond to such assaults. It is our responsibility as responsible internet users to be aware of the dangers posed by such assaults and to take the necessary precautions to safeguard both ourselves and our companies.
