## Lab6

|Phase	|Description|	Solar Winds Exploit|
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
|Reconnaissance|Gathering information about the target|No evidence of this phase being used|
|Weaponization|Creating a weapon (malware) to deliver to the target|Solar Winds' Orion software was weaponized with a backdoor malware|
|Delivery|Delivering the weapon (malware) to the target|The malware was delivered through a software update to Solar Winds' Orion software|
|Exploitation|Executing the weapon (malware) to gain a foothold in the target system|The malware exploited a vulnerability in the Orion software and gained access to the system|
|Installation|Installing a persistent presence on the target system|The malware installed a backdoor that allowed for persistent access to the system|
|Command and Control|Establishing a channel for remote control of the target system|The malware communicated with a command and control server to receive instructions and exfiltrate data|
|Actions on Objectives|Achieving the attacker's objectives (data exfiltration, disruption, etc.)|The attacker was able to exfiltrate data from multiple targets|


Possible mitigations for each phase and the tools that can be utilized:

|Phase	|Mitigations|	Tools|
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
|Reconnaissance|Restrict information available online|Google Alerts, Social-Engineer Toolkit|
|Weaponization|Keep software and systems up-to-date, use multi-factor authentication|Anti-virus software, Firewall, Multi-factor authentication|
|Delivery|Monitor network traffic, scan email attachments for malware|Network traffic monitoring tools, Email filtering tools|
|Exploitation|Use intrusion detection and prevention systems, keep software and systems up-to-date|Intrusion detection and prevention systems, Anti-virus software, Software and system patching tools|
|Installation|Use endpoint detection and response systems, monitor system logs|Endpoint detection and response systems, Log analysis tools|
|Command and Control|Use network security monitoring tools, monitor outbound traffic|Network security monitoring tools, Outbound traffic monitoring tools|
|Actions on Objectives|Use data encryption, monitor data transfers|Data encryption tools, Data transfer monitoring tools|


There are no stages that cannot be recognized, however some phases, like the reconnaissance phase, which frequently relies on information that is readily available to the public, could be more challenging to identify or stop. Additionally, if the attacker has already acquired access to the target system and exfiltrated data, it can be challenging to stop the operations on objectives phase.

However, companies may significantly lower the chance of a successful cyber attack by putting the following mitigations into practice and making use of the proposed technologies. The threat landscape is complicated and always changing, so it's crucial to remember that no one tool or mitigation plan is impenetrable. Instead, a complete approach to cybersecurity is required.
