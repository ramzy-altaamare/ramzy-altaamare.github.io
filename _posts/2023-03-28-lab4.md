The security implications of the digital economy are an extremely important worry given how dependent enterprises are on digitalization. A totally digital venture is a firm that exclusively employs digital procedures and technology to achieve its goals.

A fully digital company must deal with a variety of cybersecurity problems. Data security, preventing data loss, protecting essential infrastructure, and ensuring laws and standards are followed are some of these challenges. Other problems include controlling user identities and access rights as well as safeguarding against online threats including phishing, malware, and ransomware.

For a traditional brick-and-mortar SME that wants to become a digital business, there are also a variety of cyber security challenges. Such a corporation needs have a solid infrastructure in order to provide the necessary digital resources. Additionally, a solid plan must be implemented. To safeguard against cyberattacks and data loss, it must also put in place a strong security policy.

I share Wei et al.'s (2019) and Spremic and Simunic's (2018) opinions that security is crucial to the digital economy. It is crucial now more than ever that businesses strengthen their security protocols and safeguard their digital infrastructure, particularly in light of the impending global energy crisis in 2022, which has already been linked to an increase in cyberattacks.

## Reflection:

The growing reliance of businesses on digitization generates legitimate worries about the security implications of the digital economy. Significant obstacles must be overcome for a corporation to become fully digital, especially in the area of cybersecurity. Data security, preventing data loss, safeguarding infrastructure, and upholding laws and regulations are only a few of the problems brought up that show how complex these problems are.
Strong security measures are more important than ever in the linked world of today, where cyber dangers are always changing. The complexity of the security landscape is further highlighted by the dangers involved in managing user identities and access permissions as well as fighting against online dangers like phishing, malware, and ransomware.
The reflection acknowledges the additional difficulties conventional brick-and-mortar SMEs confront when attempting to adopt digitization. To safeguard against cyberattacks and data breaches, these companies must first build a robust digital infrastructure, put in place a thorough security strategy, and create a sound plan.
The citations of Wei et al. (2019) and Spremic and Simunic's (2018) viewpoints highlight the general agreement about the significance of security in the digital economy. Businesses must prioritize enhancing their security procedures and protecting their digital infrastructure, it is acknowledged. A reminder of the changing threat landscape and the demand for ongoing attention is provided by the mention of the impending global energy crisis in 2022 and its link to an increase in cyberattacks.
Overall, the analysis emphasizes how crucial security issues are in the digital economy. As the repercussions of ignoring these problems may be dire, it motivates firms to be proactive in solving cybersecurity threats. Enterprises may traverse the digital world with more confidence and resilience by realizing the importance of security and taking the necessary precautions to secure their digital assets.
