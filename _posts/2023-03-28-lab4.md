The security implications of the digital economy are an extremely important worry given how dependent enterprises are on digitalization. A totally digital venture is a firm that exclusively employs digital procedures and technology to achieve its goals.

A fully digital company must deal with a variety of cybersecurity problems. Data security, preventing data loss, protecting essential infrastructure, and ensuring laws and standards are followed are some of these challenges. Other problems include controlling user identities and access rights as well as safeguarding against online threats including phishing, malware, and ransomware.

For a traditional brick-and-mortar SME that wants to become a digital business, there are also a variety of cyber security challenges. Such a corporation needs have a solid infrastructure in order to provide the necessary digital resources. Additionally, a solid plan must be implemented. To safeguard against cyberattacks and data loss, it must also put in place a strong security policy.

I share Wei et al.'s (2019) and Spremic and Simunic's (2018) opinions that security is crucial to the digital economy. It is crucial now more than ever that businesses strengthen their security protocols and safeguard their digital infrastructure, particularly in light of the impending global energy crisis in 2022, which has already been linked to an increase in cyberattacks.
