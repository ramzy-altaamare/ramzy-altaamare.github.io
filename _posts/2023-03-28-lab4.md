The security implications of the digital economy are an extremely important worry given how dependent enterprises are on digitalization. A totally digital venture is a firm that exclusively employs digital procedures and technology to achieve its goals.

A fully digital company must deal with a variety of cybersecurity problems. Data security, preventing data loss, protecting essential infrastructure, and ensuring laws and standards are followed are some of these challenges. Other problems include controlling user identities and access rights as well as safeguarding against online threats including phishing, malware, and ransomware.

For a traditional brick-and-mortar SME that wants to become a digital business, there are also a variety of cyber security challenges. Such a corporation needs have a solid infrastructure in order to provide the necessary digital resources. Additionally, a solid plan must be implemented. To safeguard against cyberattacks and data loss, it must also put in place a strong security policy.

I share Wei et al.'s (2019) and Spremic and Simunic's (2018) opinions that security is crucial to the digital economy. It is crucial now more than ever that businesses strengthen their security protocols and safeguard their digital infrastructure, particularly in light of the impending global energy crisis in 2022, which has already been linked to an increase in cyberattacks.

## Reflection:

Various facets of our life have undergone a dramatic upheaval as a result of digitalization. Businesses' adoption of digital technology has profoundly changed several industries, procedures, and systems. Productivity has grown and costs have decreased as a result of automation, real-time data availability, and simplified procedures. The advantages of digitization also include better customer experiences and increased decision-making skills.
Digitalization has also sparked a wave of innovation and business prospects. Now that small firms and entrepreneurs have access to international markets, the playing field has been leveled and economic growth has been promoted. Digital platforms have evolved into collaboration's catalysts, facilitating the sharing of ideas and the creation of ground-breaking goods and services. Rapid information distribution through social networks and online communities has encouraged knowledge exchange and a sense of connectivity on a global scale.
Despite the many benefits, the digital world is facing certain difficulties. Due to the growing collection and sharing of personal information, privacy and data security have grown to be serious issues. To preserve trust in the digital age, it's crucial to strike a balance between using data for innovation and preserving people's right to privacy. To provide equal access to technology and digital literacy, it is also essential to combat the digital gap. A more inclusive and equitable digital society will result from efforts to close the access and education divide.
In summary, digitization has transformed industries, aided in innovation, and linked individuals in ways that were never possible before. It has streamlined procedures, given entrepreneurs more authority, and promoted international cooperation. To achieve digital inclusion, it is crucial to solve privacy and security issues. By doing this, we can fully realize the potential of digitization and build a successful, open future for everyone.
